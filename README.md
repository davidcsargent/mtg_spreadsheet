As I am new to paper Magic I thought it would be useful to create a spreadsheet to track the cards I have aquired. Having looked online I struggled to find a template as most were being directed to online databases for the most of which a subscription is payable.
My Magic the Gathering Spreadsheet Template aims to provide a simple way to catalogue my cards in the early days. I think my final aim is to end up with a good quality spreadsheet template anyone can use or a database template.
